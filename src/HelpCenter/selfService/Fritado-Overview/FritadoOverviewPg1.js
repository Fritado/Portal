          <p>
            To log into your Seona dashboard, visit seona.usestyle.ai. If you
            are already logged in, you will be redirected to your dashboard.
            Otherwise, you will see Seona starting screen where you can input
            your business URL. To log in from the starting screen, click “Sign
            in” at the top right hand corner. ​

          <p>
            Yes! Seona supports all major languages and you can choose which
            language you would like Seona to write blog posts and code changes
            in during onboarding.
          </p>

          <h3>Can I have multiple projects under one account?</h3>
          <p>
            You can add multiple Seona projects to one Style account! Here’s how
            to do so:
          </p>
          <ol className="li-size">
            <li className="li-size">Make sure you’re logged into Seona.</li>
            <li className="li-size">
              Click on the dropdown on the upper right hand corner
            </li>
            <li className="li-size">Select “Add website”</li>
            <li className="li-size">
              You will be taken to the onboarding page of Seona again, where you
              can input the URL of another domain you wish to connect to Seona.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You can also switch between your different projects by clicking the
            dropdown in the upper right corner.
