            <p>Common reasons include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The domain you inputted could not be visited. Try inputting the
                scanned URL into a web browser to verify this. If your website
                is hosted on a different subdomain, make sure your base domain
                reroutes to the correct subdomain.
              </li>
              <li>
                The domain you entered is not secure, and is only hosted through
                HTTP, not HTTPS. This is crucial for your website to appear on
                search engines like Google, and requires a valid SSL
                certificate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your website took too long to load, and our servers timed out
                when attempting to visit it. Make sure you website page load
                speed is reasonable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our servers may be down at this time. Please try again in a few
                minutes.
              </li>
            </ul>

              We only allow one Seona project per domain, so if you try to
              register a project with a domain that has already been claimed,
              you will be prompted to either:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Register another domain OR</li>

              <li>
                Contact support if you want to transfer ownership of the domain
              </li>
